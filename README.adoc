= URL Classpath Scanner

This adds specific support for the URL Classpath Scanner. As we are not able to detect the paths of other scanners, they are not supported currently.

Simply pass a URLClassLoader to the ClasspathScanner and it will give you back a series of resources. You can also register one or more listeners before
you scan and they will be notified of all interested resources. The listener is the ResourceScanListener.
